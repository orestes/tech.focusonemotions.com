We'd like to talk about a meetup our Software Development Team feels very close with. The Barcelona Android User Group is a monthly meetup where programmers get together to discuss and share projects, tools and experiences related to the Android world.

The meetup started back in October 2013 with a talk by  **Orestes Carracedo**, "Android as a Digital Signage platform". To this day we've never missed a meetup and we're happy to see the group grow to as it has :)

Today, **Orestes Carracedo** and **Javier Morales**, Software Development [team members], will speak about integrating Push Notifications in a Digital signage platform as an optimization measure in the content distribution service. 

They'll guide us in creating an Android project from scratch using the Google Cloud Messaging API and showcase a small, simple, but working demo. 

This event will take place at 19:00, Barcelona's [Mobile World Centre], in Plaça Catalunya.

See you there!
