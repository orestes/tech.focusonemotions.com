          <h2>The Team</h2>
<p class="meta">09 May 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Focus On Emotions was founded in 2004. The Systems team was created in 2008 and in 2010 we created the Software Development team, taking over outsourced projects to gain more control and flexibility. Through this years we&#39;ve built a network of services and applications that power our Digital Signage products and faced some serious challenges in the way. We&#39;d like to write a bit about them, where we failed and where we succeeded.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been some rotation so there are a few developers that where part of the team but left some time ago. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Virginie Fauré</strong> Senior Web Developer</li>
<li><strong>Valentí Gamez</strong> Web Developer</li>
</ul>

<p>Without them we wouldn&#39;t be here today so we&#39;d like to thank them for their time with us. You guys rock! ;)</p>

<p>This is the current lineup:</p>
